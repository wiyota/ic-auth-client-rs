# Example for Leptos

## Getting Started

Both dfx and trunk commands occupy the console while running, so you'll need to use separate terminal windows for each.

First, in one terminal, start the local PocketIC:

```bash
dfx start
```

Then, in a second terminal, deploy your canisters and start the Trunk development server:

```bash
dfx deploy

trunk serve
```

## Prerequisites

- [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk)
