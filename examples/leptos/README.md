# Example for Leptos

## Getting Started

Both dfx and trunk commands occupy the console while running, so you'll need to use separate terminal windows for each.

First, in one terminal, start the local PocketIC:

```bash
dfx start
```

Then, in a second terminal, deploy your canisters and start the Trunk development server:

```bash
make deploy

trunk serve
```

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk)
- [IC SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk)
